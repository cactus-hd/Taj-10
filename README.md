TAJ 10 — Web-Based Operating System Platform

TAJ 10 is a modern, web-based operating system built with Next.js, React, and a remote-first architecture.
It delivers an OS-like experience directly in the browser through a powerful Web Viewer, modular kernel apps, and AI-assisted system operations.

TAJ 10 is designed as a scalable, extensible platform, not just a UI concept — enabling real system-level workflows inside a web environment.
